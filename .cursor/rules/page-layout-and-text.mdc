# Page layout and text alignment

**Default for every new page:** Use Chairman-style spacing and left-aligned content. Do not center-align body matter. Apply these rules by default when creating or editing any page—no need to be asked.

When building or redesigning pages (Chairman, Principal, CSE department, facilities, leader or content pages), **use the same spacing as the Chairman page** and keep text **left-aligned** (content matter must not be center-aligned).

## Spacing (match Chairman page exactly)

Use these container and section classes so content occupies more width and layout is consistent:

- **Hero section:** `container mx-auto px-4 md:px-8` — no `max-w-*` so content uses full container width.
- **Content sections (main body):** `container mx-auto px-4 md:px-10 lg:px-12` — reduced left/right spacing so text is wider. **Do not** add `max-w-5xl` or `max-w-6xl`; leave container full width.
- **Section vertical padding:** `py-20 md:py-28` for main content sections (same as Chairman message/quote sections).

Reference: `src/pages/Chairman.tsx` — hero uses `px-4 md:px-8`, content uses `px-4 md:px-10 lg:px-12` and sections use `py-20 md:py-28`.

## Do NOT center-align main content

- Body text and prose must be **left-aligned**. Avoid `text-center` for paragraphs, lists, and multi-line content.
- Use `text-center` only for short, intentional elements (e.g. a single CTA, or a number in a stat pill).
- Headings and section titles: **left-aligned** unless a design explicitly requires a centered hero title.

## Text format and alignment

- Text: **left-aligned**, clear hierarchy (section label → title → body), consistent spacing.
- Cards with icon + body: **left-aligned text**; icon and title left-aligned (no `mx-auto` on content).

Apply this to all page redesigns and new pages so spacing and alignment match Chairman and text stays wide and readable.
